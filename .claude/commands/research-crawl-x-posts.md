# Research Crawl X Posts

**Argument:** $ARGUMENTS (required — see Runtime Inputs)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or missing required fields, STOP and report which fields are absent.

---

## Preamble

### Runtime Inputs

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:

```
--handles=[h1,h2,...]            [JSON-style array of bare X/Twitter handles — non-empty; no leading @, no URL. A leading @ is stripped during normalization. Singular invocation expressed as a single-element array.]
--raw-output-dir={PATH}          [absolute path to a directory where per-handle rendered markdown files will be written]
--max-per-handle={N}             [positive integer per-handle cost-cap; MUST be ≥ 1 — see §1.0 Step 3 + §6.0 row max-per-handle-zero]

# Optional power params (omit when not needed):
--days={N}                       [positive integer time window in days; default 1]
```

Validation rules (before §1.0):

- `--handles`, `--raw-output-dir`, and `--max-per-handle` mandatory. If any missing, STOP and report which.
- `--handles` must parse as a non-empty JSON array of strings. Else reject (`handles-malformed`).
- Normalize each handle by stripping a single leading `@`; the remainder must match the X handle shape (1–15 characters, `[A-Za-z0-9_]` only). First failing entry → STOP and report (`handles-malformed`).
- `--raw-output-dir` must be absolute. Reject relative paths (caller owns path resolution).
- `--max-per-handle` must parse as integer ≥ 1. Zero rejected per §6.0 `max-per-handle-zero`.
- `--days` must parse as a positive integer when supplied; default 1.

If any validation fails, STOP and report which field failed.

### Global References

```

```

Leaf does not read tool guides at runtime — parameter choices in §1.0 Step 4 and the execution procedure in §3.0 already encode the pitfalls (cost-safety cap via per-handle `maxItems`, search-mode date targeting via `from:`/`since:`/`until:` since handle-mode ignores the date window, one Apify run per handle since `maxItems` is per-run-total, `call-actor` with `waitSecs:45` inline + `get-actor-run` poll fallback (no `async` flag), `{noResults}` sentinel filtering, fetch-time narrow-field projection via the `get-dataset-items` `fields=` param, group by `author.userName` for the per-source split).

Article-enrichment pitfalls (§3.0 Step 3, `APIFY_ARTICLE_ACTOR`), all live-confirmed 2026-06-16: pass the HOST tweet id — the tweet's own `id` for a standalone article, `quote.id` for a quoted article — NEVER `article.id` or the `/i/article/{id}` id (both return empty `md`); the actor pads its dataset to a fixed 10-row minimum with mock filler (`{id:0, text:"mock data"}`, no `tweet_id`, no `md`), so keep only rows carrying a `tweet_id` AND a non-empty `md` and discard the rest; cost is a flat per-call floor (output always pads to 10, input caps at 10 → ≤$0.05/call at BRONZE regardless of real-id count), so batch all candidate ids for the whole invocation into one ≤10-id call (chunk into successive ≤10 calls only past 10 candidates); non-article ids return `md:""` (clean negative, zero false positives); Apify is the only path — Exa/Firecrawl cannot reach the login-gated `/i/article/` body.

### Caller Isolation

Pure primitive — no agent spawn, no pipeline agents, no telemetry. The skill runs the Apify calls + dataset render directly in whatever context invokes it; the caller absorbs the MCP dataset context cost (raw tweet items land in the caller's window). Callers crawling many handles — or composing this leaf alongside other work — wrap the invocation in their own isolation:

```
Agent({subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sonnet", prompt: "Invoke /research-crawl-x-posts with <args>"})
```

Consumer skills document their own isolation choice. The run-pulse composer wraps each source-type leaf in one classifier sub-agent per source-type.

---

## 1.0 Context Capture

### Step 1: Verify raw output directory parent exists

Check the parent directory of `--raw-output-dir` exists. If not, route to §6.0 (`raw-output-parent-missing`). Do not create parents — caller owns path resolution. The `--raw-output-dir` itself MAY or MAY NOT exist; §3.0 Step 1 creates it via `mkdir -p` before writing the first per-handle file.

### Step 2: Normalize and validate handles

For each entry in `--handles`: strip a single leading `@`, then confirm the remainder matches the X handle shape (1–15 characters, `[A-Za-z0-9_]` only). Build `handles[]` of normalized bare handles preserving caller order. First entry that fails the shape → route to §6.0 (`handles-malformed`) with the offending value named.

### Step 3: Validate `--max-per-handle` lower bound

Confirm `--max-per-handle ≥ 1`. If `--max-per-handle == 0`, route to §6.0 (`max-per-handle-zero`): pass a positive integer. `--max-per-handle` is the per-handle `maxItems` cap. Total estimated cost ≈ `N_handles × max-per-handle × $0.0004` at the BRONZE/paid Apify tier; the FREE tier is 100× ($0.04/tweet) and only safe on a paid plan.

### Step 4: Compute date window and construct per-handle Actor inputs

Compute the window:

```
since = (today - days)  formatted YYYY-MM-DD     # lower bound, inclusive
until = (today + 1 day)  formatted YYYY-MM-DD     # upper bound, EXCLUSIVE — +1 day so today is included
```

For each handle `h` in `handles[]`, build a per-handle Actor input (one run per handle — `maxItems` is per-run-total, so a shared batched run starves trailing handles):

```
ACTOR_INPUT[h] = {
  searchTerms: ["from:{h} since:{since} until:{until}"],
  maxItems: {--max-per-handle},
  sort: "Latest",
  includeSearchTerms: true,
}
```

Cost-safety note: `maxItems` is the only verified-functional cost cap on this Actor. Do NOT add `maxTotalChargeUsd` (untested / non-functional on the sibling Actor; caps silently ignored). Do NOT set `customMapFunction` — the Actor README warns that using it for filtering triggers an automatic ban; filtering happens downstream, not in the input. Targeting MUST use `searchTerms` with `from:`/`since:`/`until:` — the `twitterHandles` + `start`/`end` path silently ignores the date window.

---

## 2.0 Plan & Confirm

Skill runs autonomously — no user pause. Pure primitive; executes directly in the caller's context. Composed leaves never gate parallelization; direct invocations log the execution config and proceed.


State the planned execution config in one structured log statement, then proceed directly to §3.0:

```
## /research-crawl-x-posts — executing crawl

handles:               {handles[]}                      # N normalized handles in caller-supplied order
raw_output_dir:        {--raw-output-dir}
max_per_handle:        {--max-per-handle}                # per-handle maxItems cap
days:                  {--days}                          # default 1
window:                {since} .. {until}                # until exclusive
actor:                 {APIFY_ACTOR_ID}
article_enrichment:    {APIFY_ARTICLE_ACTOR}             # §3.0 Step 3 second-hop; one batched ≤10-id call across all handles, fires only when article candidates exist
execution:             direct (pure primitive — no sub-agent spawn); one Apify run per handle
invocation:            call-actor waitSecs:45 inline → get-actor-run poll if not yet terminal (no `async` param)
```

---

## 3.0 Crawl & Enrich

Execute the crawl directly — no sub-agent spawn. Run the Apify `apidojo/tweet-scraper` Actor once per handle (search-mode, date-windowed), enrich any X Article posts with their full body (Step 3), then write per-handle rendered markdown files into `--raw-output-dir`. This step writes raw bytes only — it does NOT classify (Authored/Reposted/Mentioned), summarize, template-fill, or filter beyond the `{noResults}` sentinel and the per-handle cap; the composing router or domain orchestrator handles all downstream transformation. Article enrichment is raw-recovery, not transformation — it restores the verbatim article body that `apidojo/tweet-scraper` collapsed to a bare `t.co` link; it never classifies or summarizes.

### Inputs (from §1.0)

```
Handles:               {handles[]}                       # N normalized handles in caller-supplied order
Raw output dir:        {--raw-output-dir}
Max per handle:        {--max-per-handle}                 # per-handle maxItems cap
Window:                {since} .. {until}                 # until exclusive
Actor:                 apidojo/tweet-scraper
Actor input (JSON):    {ACTOR_INPUT[h]}                   # one per handle — searchTerms from:{h} since:{since} until:{until}
invocation:            call-actor waitSecs:45 → poll get-actor-run if not terminal
```

The Actor inputs were auto-constructed in §1.0 Step 4. Do NOT substitute different params. Do NOT add `maxTotalChargeUsd`. Invoke via `call-actor` with `waitSecs` (0–45) — there is NO `async` flag on the MCP tool. `waitSecs:45` waits inline (this Actor finishes in ~5s, so the run is usually terminal on return); fall back to `get-actor-run` polling only when a run is still running.

### Procedure

Execute these steps in order:

```
1. Ensure {--raw-output-dir} exists. Use Bash `mkdir -p {--raw-output-dir}`.

2. For EACH handle h in handles[] (one Apify run per handle):

   a. Call mcp__apify__call-actor with { actor: apidojo/tweet-scraper,
      input: ACTOR_INPUT[h], waitSecs: 45 }. The MCP tool has NO `async`
      flag — `waitSecs` (0–45) sets the inline wait. Capture `runId`, the
      dataset id at `storages.datasets.default.id`, and `status`. If
      `status === "SUCCEEDED"` already (typical — Actor finishes in ~5s),
      skip step 2b and go straight to step 2c.

   b. If step 2a's run was not yet terminal, poll
      mcp__apify__get-actor-run({ runId, waitSecs: 30 }) — the param blocks
      server-side up to 30s per call — re-calling until `status` reaches one of:
      - `SUCCEEDED` — proceed to step 2c.
      - `FAILED` / `ABORTED` / `TIMED-OUT` — this handle's run failed. Skip
        steps 2c-2e; write an empty placeholder file for h (so callers can
        rely on one file per requested handle), set this handle's
        crawl_status: failed with diagnostic = run failure reason, continue
        to the next handle.
      Maximum poll duration per handle: 600 seconds. If still not terminal
      after 600s, abandon polling for h, treat as failed, write placeholder,
      continue with diagnostic = "Actor run exceeded 600s poll budget".

   c. Fetch this run's dataset via mcp__apify__get-dataset-items({
        datasetId: {storages.datasets.default.id}, limit: 1000,
        fields: "id,fullText,text,url,twitterUrl,createdAt,author.userName,isRetweet,isQuote,isReply,isPinned,inReplyToUsername,likeCount,retweetCount,replyCount,quoteCount,viewCount,quote.author.userName,quote.text,quote.id,article.id,article.title,article.previewText,retweet.author.userName,retweet.text,noResults,entities.media.media_url_https,extendedEntities.media.media_url_https,entities.media.type" }).
      - The `fields=` param projects AT FETCH TIME and supports nested
        dot-notation (server auto-flattens parent prefixes) — so the raw
        ~198-field payload never enters caller context. This is the
        dataset-read tool's `fields` param, NOT the Actor INPUT `fields[]`
        (which is top-level-only; see step 2e note).
      - `quote.id` + the top-level `article.*` fields are the article-detection
        signals consumed by Step 3 (see step 2e); the rest carry the tweet body
        and structural flags.
      - Paginate via `offset` only when the dataset exceeds 1000 items
        (rare — bounded by max-per-handle).

   d. Filter out sentinel records where `noResults === true`. The remaining
      items are h's tweets. (A handle with no tweets in the window returns
      only the sentinel → tweets array is empty → crawl_status: empty.)

   e. The narrow field set is already projected by step 2c's `fields=` param
      (the raw record otherwise carries ~198 fields). The kept fields:
        id, fullText (fallback `text`), url (fallback `twitterUrl`),
        createdAt, author.userName, isRetweet, isQuote, isReply, isPinned,
        quote.author.userName, quote.text, quote.id, article.id, article.title,
        article.previewText, retweet.author.userName, retweet.text,
        inReplyToUsername, and media URLs
        (entities.media + extendedEntities.media `media_url_https`).
      Note — nested objects use `.text`, not `.fullText`: the nested quote/
      retweet payloads carry `quote.text` / `retweet.text`; `.fullText`
      exists only at the top level (verified via live probe). The
      get-dataset-items `fields=` param resolves all these nested keys; the
      top-level-only limitation belongs to the Apify Actor INPUT `fields[]`,
      not this dataset-read tool.
      Article-detection fields (live-confirmed 2026-06-16): a STANDALONE X
      Article populates a top-level `article` object (`article.id` /
      `article.title` / truncated `article.previewText`) while its `fullText`
      collapses to a bare t.co; a QUOTED article exposes NO `quote.article.*`
      object — only `quote.id` plus a link-collapsed `quote.text`. Both are
      consumed by Step 3.

3. Article-enrichment pass (cross-handle, single batched second-hop). After all
   handles are crawled and projected (Step 2), recover the full body of any X
   Article posts that `apidojo/tweet-scraper` collapsed to a bare t.co link.
   Detection + enrichment run ONCE across all handles' tweets — not per-handle —
   so the fixed cost floor (see Global References) is paid at most once per
   invocation.

   a. Detect article candidates across every projected tweet in this
      invocation. Two shapes, both live-confirmed:
      - STANDALONE authored article: top-level `article.id` present on the
        tweet. Candidate host id = the tweet's OWN `id`. (Free detection via the
        `article` object; the actor is still needed because `article.previewText`
        is truncated.)
      - QUOTED article: `isQuote === true` AND the quoted layer is
        link-collapsed. Mechanical test: strip every t.co/x.com URL and all
        whitespace from `quote.text`; the layer is link-collapsed when the
        residual is empty (no prose remains). Candidate host id = `quote.id`.
        (No `quote.article.*` object exists, so this is the only signal. A
        `quote.text` with residual prose is NOT a candidate — a missed real
        article is cheaper than burning the ≤10-id batch budget, and a false
        candidate that slips through returns `md:""` harmlessly.)
      Build a deduped set CANDIDATE_IDS, and a back-reference recording for each
      candidate id every tweet it belongs to plus whether each occurrence is
      that tweet's OWN body (standalone) or its QUOTED layer — needed for Step 4
      render injection. The same host id can occur in BOTH roles within one
      handle (a self-quote of one's own article); record every occurrence.

   b. If CANDIDATE_IDS is empty, skip enrichment entirely (no actor call, no
      cost); proceed to Step 4 with an empty ARTICLE_MD map.

   c. Enrich in batches of ≤10 ids (APIFY_ARTICLE_ACTOR caps tweetIds at 10).
      For each batch, call mcp__apify__call-actor with { actor:
      APIFY_ARTICLE_ACTOR, input: { tweetIds: [<batch>] }, waitSecs: 45 }. The
      actor takes ~30s; if not terminal on return, poll
      mcp__apify__get-actor-run({ runId, waitSecs: 30 }) up to a 120s budget per
      batch.

   d. Fetch each batch's dataset via mcp__apify__get-dataset-items({ datasetId,
      limit: 20, fields: "tweet_id,md" }). Build ARTICLE_MD as { host_id → md },
      keeping ONLY rows where `tweet_id` is present AND `md` is non-empty.
      Discard the fixed mock-padding rows ({id:0, text:"mock data"} — no
      tweet_id, no md) and empty-`md` rows (non-article ids — clean negative,
      zero false positives).

   e. An article-actor batch that FAILS / ABORTS / TIMES-OUT is NON-FATAL — the
      handle crawls already succeeded. Log a one-line diagnostic, leave those
      ids out of ARTICLE_MD, and let Step 4 fall back to the bare-link render
      for the affected tweets. Never fail the whole invocation on an enrichment
      miss. Set `article_enrichment_status: partial` in that case (else
      `clean`, or `skipped` when CANDIDATE_IDS was empty).

4. For each handle, render its projected tweet array to a markdown file inside
   {--raw-output-dir}. Filename rule:

     filename = `handle-{h}.md`     # h lowercased

   File structure per handle:

   ---
   type: X Posts Crawl Raw
   schema: ephemeral-raw-crawl
   source_tool: apidojo/tweet-scraper
   handle: {h}
   window_start: {since}
   window_end: {until}             # exclusive
   days: {--days}
   crawled_at: {ISO 8601 timestamp of this run}
   apify_run_id: {runId for this handle}
   tweet_count: {N tweets after sentinel filter}
   articles_enriched: {count of DISTINCT article bodies rendered in full for this handle — i.e. |rendered_article_ids| for this handle; back-references and a self-quote's second occurrence do NOT re-count; 0 when none}
   input_params:
     max_per_handle: {--max-per-handle}
   ---

   # X Posts — @{h}

   ## Tweet 1 — @{author.userName} — {createdAt date}
   URL: {url}
   Engagement: {likeCount} likes · {retweetCount} reposts · {replyCount} replies · {quoteCount} quotes

   {tweet body — fullText; preserve original line breaks}

   ---

   ## Tweet 2 — ...

   Rendering rules:
   - Each tweet is one H2 section separated by horizontal rules (`---`).
   - H2 heading: author handle + tweet date. Body is fullText verbatim
     (preserve newlines; keep bare t.co / x.com URLs as-is).
   - Render-once rule (article bodies): each recovered host id's full body is
     written at most ONCE per handle file, at the first occurrence (in tweet
     render order) where it is SUCCESSFULLY rendered in full. Track a
     `rendered_article_ids` set, adding a host id only when its full body is
     actually written (at render time, on success) — NOT at detection time — so
     a first occurrence that hit an enrichment miss (bare-link fallback) never
     blocks a later occurrence from attempting its own full render. A later
     occurrence of an already-rendered host id (the self-quote case — a host id
     that is both a standalone tweet and another tweet's quoted layer) renders a
     one-line back-reference instead of duplicating the body: `Article '{title}'
     — full body rendered at Tweet {N} above`, where `{title}` is `article.title`
     for a standalone host or the recovered body's first H1 heading for a quoted
     host (no `quote.article.title` field exists). The set is per-handle by
     design — it resets for each handle file so every file is self-sufficient;
     the same article quoted by two handles renders fully in both files.
   - STANDALONE X Article injection: when the tweet's own `id` is in ARTICLE_MD
     (Step 3 — its `fullText` was a bare t.co) and not yet in
     `rendered_article_ids`, replace the body with a `Article — full body
     recovered:` marker line followed by the verbatim `ARTICLE_MD[id]` markdown
     (preserve its headings, links, and image refs), then add `id` to
     `rendered_article_ids`. If `id` is already in `rendered_article_ids`, emit
     the back-reference line per the render-once rule. When the tweet had an
     `article.id` candidate but enrichment missed (`id` not in ARTICLE_MD —
     actor failure/empty), fall back to the verbatim `fullText` (the bare t.co)
     and append ` (article body not recovered)`.
   - Engagement line is one line, dot-separated; omit a count when absent.
   - For a repost (`isRetweet: true`): H2 reflects the ORIGINAL author
     (@{retweet.author.userName}); insert
     `Reposted by: @{author.userName}` between the Engagement line and body;
     body is the original tweet text (retweet.text).
   - For a quote-tweet (`isQuote: true`): H2 reflects the watched handle as
     author; body is their commentary (fullText); the quoted original renders
     below in a blockquote under a `Quoted:` sub-heading showing
     @{quote.author.userName} + quote.text. QUOTED X Article injection: when
     `quote.id` is in ARTICLE_MD (Step 3 — the quoted layer was a collapsed
     article) and not yet in `rendered_article_ids`, render the `Quoted:`
     sub-heading line showing @{quote.author.userName}, then the verbatim
     `ARTICLE_MD[quote.id]` markdown as its own block BELOW the sub-heading —
     NOT `>`-prefixed inside the blockquote. The recovered body carries its own
     `#` headings, `>` blockquotes, and `![image]` refs; wrapping it in an outer
     blockquote would mangle that nested markdown, so a quoted article breaks
     out of the blockquote exactly like a standalone one. Fence it between
     `<!-- quoted article: {title} -->` … `<!-- /quoted article -->` HTML
     comment markers so the boundary is unambiguous, then add `quote.id` to
     `rendered_article_ids`. If `quote.id` is already rendered, emit the
     back-reference line per the render-once rule (no second full body). On an
     enrichment miss, keep the bare-t.co `quote.text` in the normal `Quoted:`
     blockquote and append ` (article body not recovered)`.
   - For a reply (`isReply: true`): insert `Reply to: @{inReplyToUsername}`
     between the Engagement line and body.
   - For pinned tweets (`isPinned: true`): append ` (pinned)` to the H2.
   - For media-bearing tweets, render `Media: 1 image | 2 images | 1 video`
     as a one-line reference; do NOT embed media URLs (expiry unverified).
   - Classification (Authored / Reposted / Mentioned / Drop) is NOT performed
     here — the leaf surfaces the structural facts (the isRetweet/isQuote/
     isReply flags via the rendering above, original authors named); the
     caller or classifier sub-agent classifies.

   When `tweet_count: 0` for a handle (no tweets in window, quiet account):
   body has frontmatter + H1 + single line `No tweets returned for this handle
   in the configured window.` Per-handle `crawl_status: empty` — an empty
   window is a clean operational outcome, not a failure.

   When this handle's run failed (step 2b abort path): placeholder carries the
   file-level frontmatter + H1 + single line `Crawl failed for this handle —
   see diagnostic in return summary.` Per-handle `crawl_status: failed`.

5. Build `per_source_outputs[]` array — one entry per handle in caller order:

     per_source_outputs[i] = {
       handle:            {handles[i]},
       raw_output_path:   {--raw-output-dir}/handle-{handles[i]}.md,
       tweet_count:       {len(projected tweets for handles[i])},
       articles_enriched: {count of DISTINCT article bodies rendered in full for this handle = |rendered_article_ids| for this handle; back-references don't re-count},
       char_count:        {wc -c on the rendered file},
       crawl_status:      {"clean" | "empty" | "failed"},   # per-handle
       apify_run_id:      {runId for this handle},
       diagnostic:        {one-line note when crawl_status == failed; otherwise omit},
     }

   Status semantics:
   - `clean`  — handle returned ≥1 tweet; run SUCCEEDED.
   - `empty`  — handle returned zero tweets in window (only the sentinel).
   - `failed` — this handle's run FAILED/ABORTED/TIMED-OUT; placeholder written.

6. Compute aggregate fields:

     total_char_count        = sum(entry.char_count for entry in per_source_outputs)
     total_tweet_count       = sum(entry.tweet_count for entry in per_source_outputs)
     total_articles_enriched = sum(entry.articles_enriched for entry in per_source_outputs)
     overall_crawl_status = (
       "clean"   if all entries have crawl_status in {clean, empty}
       else "failed"  if all entries have crawl_status == "failed"
       else "partial"
     )

   Note: `empty` entries do NOT degrade overall status — an empty window is a
   clean outcome. Only mixed clean+failed or all-failed produces
   `partial`/`failed` aggregate. Article enrichment never affects
   `crawl_status` — an enrichment miss is logged via `article_enrichment_status`
   (Step 3e), not the crawl aggregate.

7. Read-back: list {--raw-output-dir} and confirm exactly N files exist (one per
   handle). Mismatch → set overall_crawl_status = "failed" with diagnostic =
   "post-write reconciliation failed: expected N files, found M".
```

### Capture

After the read-back (step 7), capture the structured summary as `CRAWL_RETURN` and proceed to §4.0:

```
raw_output_dir:            {--raw-output-dir}
char_count:                <total across all per-handle files>     # aggregate
tweet_count:               <total across all per-handle groups>    # aggregate
articles_enriched:         <total across all handles — see step 6>
article_enrichment_status: <clean | partial | skipped>             # partial = ≥1 actor batch failed (Step 3e); skipped = no candidates
crawl_status:              <clean | partial | failed>              # aggregate
window_start:              {since}
window_end:                {until}                                 # exclusive
per_source_outputs:        [<one entry per handle — see step 5>]
diagnostic:                <one-line note when crawl_status != clean OR article_enrichment_status == partial; otherwise omit>
```

Do NOT surface raw tweet content or the Apify dataset to the caller — both are on disk at `{--raw-output-dir}` (rendered) or in Apify storage (raw JSON, 7-day retention). §5.0 returns the reference plus summary only.

## 4.0 Verify

### Step 1: File-state verification

Verify the raw output directory and per-handle files:

- [ ] Directory exists at `--raw-output-dir` (use Bash: `test -d {DIR}`).
- [ ] One file per handle exists at each `CRAWL_RETURN.per_source_outputs[i].raw_output_path`.
- [ ] When `entry.crawl_status == clean`: file is non-empty (`char_count > 200`). File-level frontmatter alone exceeds 200 bytes, so any clean entry must have `char_count > 200`.
- [ ] When `entry.crawl_status == empty`: file is a placeholder with `char_count > 0` (frontmatter + empty-window line).
- [ ] When `entry.crawl_status == failed`: file is present with `char_count > 0` (placeholder body + diagnostic).

If any check fails (entry status `clean` but file empty/missing, file count ≠ N handles), route to §6.0 (`agent-write-mismatch`).

---

## 5.0 Summary

Return this structured summary to the caller (typically the `/run-pulse` composer):

```
raw_output_dir:            {CRAWL_RETURN.raw_output_dir}
char_count:                {CRAWL_RETURN.char_count}            # aggregate
tweet_count:               {CRAWL_RETURN.tweet_count}           # aggregate
articles_enriched:         {CRAWL_RETURN.articles_enriched}     # aggregate count of recovered article bodies
article_enrichment_status: {CRAWL_RETURN.article_enrichment_status}   # clean | partial | skipped
crawl_status:              {CRAWL_RETURN.crawl_status}          # clean | partial | failed
window_start:              {CRAWL_RETURN.window_start}
window_end:                {CRAWL_RETURN.window_end}            # exclusive
per_source_outputs:        {CRAWL_RETURN.per_source_outputs[]}
  # Each entry: { handle, raw_output_path, tweet_count, articles_enriched, char_count,
  #              crawl_status (clean|empty|failed per-handle), apify_run_id, diagnostic? }
diagnostic:                {CRAWL_RETURN.diagnostic if present}
```

Caller decides next action based on overall `crawl_status` (short-circuit on `failed`; proceed with extraction iteration on `clean` or `partial`) and per-handle `crawl_status` (skip extraction on entries with `crawl_status == failed`; treat `empty` as no-content-this-cycle). The leaf does not retry — the caller governs retry policy.

## 6.0 Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|---|---|
| `--handles`, `--raw-output-dir`, or `--max-per-handle` missing from `$ARGUMENTS` | STOP. Report which field is absent. |
| `handles-malformed` — `--handles` does not parse as a JSON array, OR array is empty, OR any normalized entry fails the X handle shape (1–15 chars, `[A-Za-z0-9_]`) | STOP. Report the malformed value (the offending entry when per-entry). A leading `@` is stripped before validation; full URLs are rejected — caller passes bare handles. |
| `--raw-output-dir` not an absolute path | STOP. Report the relative path; caller must resolve. |
| `--max-per-handle` does not parse as a positive integer | STOP. Report the malformed value. |
| `max-per-handle-zero` — `--max-per-handle == 0` | STOP. Report the explicit error: pass a positive integer. Zero is forbidden as a cost-safety guard (per-run-total semantics make an uncapped run unbounded). |
| `raw-output-parent-missing` — parent directory of `--raw-output-dir` does not exist | STOP. Report the missing parent path. Do not create — caller scaffolds the directory tree before invocation. The `--raw-output-dir` itself MAY or MAY NOT pre-exist; §3.0 Step 1 creates it. |
| A single handle's run produces `crawl_status: failed` (Apify FAILED / ABORTED / TIMED-OUT, or poll budget exceeded) | Write the placeholder for that handle, continue the remaining handles. The failure is isolated — aggregate becomes `partial` (or `failed` only if all handles failed). Per-handle diagnostic + `apify_run_id` surface in the return for billing audit. Do not retry within this skill. |
| Crawl produces overall `crawl_status: partial` (some handles succeeded, others failed) | Proceed to §5.0 normally. Return surfaces overall `partial` + per-handle detail in `per_source_outputs[]`. Caller iterates the array, drops failed entries from downstream extraction, continues with clean entries. |
| Crawl produces `crawl_status: empty` for one or more handles | Proceed normally. Per-handle entry surfaces `tweet_count: 0` (valid empty-window result for quiet accounts). Empty does NOT degrade aggregate status. |
| Apify monthly hard limit fires mid-run ("Monthly usage hard limit exceeded" from call-actor or get-actor-run) | Set the affected handle's `crawl_status: failed`, diagnostic = "Apify monthly hard limit exceeded — account billing-capped until next cycle". Remaining handles will hit the same limit; mark them failed without re-calling. Skill returns failure/partial to caller; caller escalates to user (billing event). |
| `call-actor` returns a 4xx error (rate limit, invalid input, Actor temporarily disabled) | Set that handle's `crawl_status: failed` with the Apify error code in the diagnostic. Same caller-decides path as failed runs. Do not retry — rate limits resolve on caller-side cool-down; invalid-input errors require caller correction. |
| `article-enrichment-failed` — an `APIFY_ARTICLE_ACTOR` batch returns FAILED / ABORTED / TIMED-OUT, or its dataset is unreadable (Step 3c–3e) | NON-FATAL. The handle crawls already succeeded. Leave the affected ids out of ARTICLE_MD; Step 4 renders the bare-t.co fallback with ` (article body not recovered)` appended. Set `article_enrichment_status: partial` + a one-line diagnostic. Never degrade `crawl_status` or fail the invocation on an enrichment miss. Do not retry within this skill. |
| `agent-write-mismatch` — the render reports an entry's `crawl_status: clean` but the file is empty/missing, OR file count in `--raw-output-dir` ≠ N handles | Surface the mismatch in the return diagnostic. Set the affected entry's `crawl_status: failed`; recompute overall status. File-state on disk is authoritative. |
| The render produces a malformed structured summary (missing fields, wrong shape, `per_source_outputs[]` length ≠ N handles) | List `--raw-output-dir` directly to recover the actual file count. Build a degraded summary from `wc -c` per file + heuristic status detection (empty body → empty, non-empty → clean). Surface the malformed summary in a diagnostic line. |
